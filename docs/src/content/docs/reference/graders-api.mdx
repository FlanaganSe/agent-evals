## Deterministic Graders

These graders are pure functions — fast, free, and reproducible.

### `exact-match`

Checks if output text exactly matches expected text.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: exact-match
```

### `contains`

Checks if output contains a substring.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: contains
    options:
      substring: "expected text"
      caseSensitive: false  # default: false
```

### `contains-all`

Checks if output contains all specified substrings.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: contains-all
    options:
      substrings: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
```

### `contains-any`

Checks if output contains at least one of the specified substrings.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: contains-any
    options:
      substrings: ["option1", "option2"]
```

### `regex`

Tests output against a regular expression.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: regex
    options:
      pattern: "\\d{3}-\\d{4}"
      flags: "i"
```

### `starts-with`

Checks if output starts with a prefix.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: starts-with
    options:
      prefix: "Hello"
```

### `ends-with`

Checks if output ends with a suffix.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: ends-with
    options:
      suffix: "Thank you."
```

### `length`

Validates output length is within bounds.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: length
    options:
      min: 10
      max: 500
```

### `json-schema`

Validates that output is valid JSON matching a schema.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: json-schema
    options:
      schema:
        type: object
        required: ["name", "age"]
```

### `json-valid`

Checks if output is valid JSON.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: json-valid
```

### `latency`

Checks if response latency is within threshold.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: latency
    options:
      maxMs: 5000
```

### `cost`

Checks if response cost is within budget.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: cost
    options:
      maxCost: 0.05  # USD
```

### `tool-called`

Checks if specific tools were called.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: tool-called
    options:
      toolName: "search"
```

### `tool-count`

Validates the number of tool calls.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: tool-count
    options:
      min: 1
      max: 3
```

### `levenshtein`

Scores based on edit distance between output and expected text.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: levenshtein
    options:
      maxDistance: 10
```

### `numeric-closeness`

Scores based on how close a numeric output is to an expected value.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: numeric-closeness
    options:
      tolerance: 0.1
```

## LLM Graders

These require a `judge` configuration in your eval config.

### `llm-rubric`

Scores output against a rubric using an LLM judge.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: llm-rubric
    options:
      rubric: |
        Score the response on helpfulness (1-5):
        5: Comprehensive, actionable answer
        1: Unhelpful or irrelevant
      passThreshold: 3
```

### `factuality`

Checks if the output is factually consistent with expected content.

```yaml
graders:
  - name: factuality
```

## Composing Graders

Apply multiple graders with weights:

```typescript
graders: [
  { name: "contains", options: { substring: "hello" }, weight: 0.3 },
  { name: "latency", options: { maxMs: 5000 }, weight: 0.2 },
  { name: "llm-rubric", options: { rubric: "..." }, weight: 0.5 },
]
```

The final score is a weighted average. A case passes if the weighted score meets the pass threshold (default: 0.5).
